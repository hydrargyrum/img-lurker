# img-lurker

img-lurker is a gallery downloader.

img-lurker takes a URL of a (HTML) web page and downloads linked images on it.
If the page contains only thumbnails, linking to a the full size version of
the image, img-lurker will rather take the bigger one.
If there are links to other HTML pages (themselves containing a the full size
image), img-lurker will follow those links to find the bigger size.

img-lurker has a "minimum image size" for considering an image is worthy of being downloaded and
isn't UI stuff like buttons/separators. img-lurker will not follow links if the link tag doesn't
contain an image tag (assumed to be the thumbnail).

## Example

Consider a site with following HTML:

    <a href="fullimage1.jpg">
        <img src="thumbnail1.jpg" />
    </a>
    <a href="fullimage2.jpg">
        <img src="thumbnail2.jpg" />
    </a>

img-lurker would download `fullimage1.jpg` and `fullimage2.jpg`.
If instead the links point to other HTML pages containing the full size version
of the images (for example `fullimage1.html` containing `fullimage1.jpg`),
img-lurker would still find `fullimage1.jpg` by following the page links.

## Options

### Cookies

    --cookie KEY=VALUE

Inject a specific cookie, which might be required to visit some restricted
access pages. For example, some subreddits require you to pass the cookie "over18=1".

The option can be passed several times to inject multiple cookies.

### Pagination

    --next-page-xpath HTML_XPATH

img-lurker can handle pagination for sites where a gallery contains so many
images that the site is split in numbered pages.
`HTML_XPATH` should be an XPath expression locating the HTML link to the "next
page".
If this argument is given, after downloading all images of a "page", img-lurker
will follow the link pointed to by `HTML_XPATH` and repeat on the next page.

Warning: this can issue a lot of traffic for huge galleries. Be cautious or you
might get blocked by the website.

### Stop/resume

    --history-file FILE

Mark all downloaded images URLs in this file and avoid redownloading URLs
present in this file.
Useful when running img-lurker multiple times on the same gallery, typically if
the gallery has received fresh images. Also useful if you use
`--next-page-xpath` option and kill img-lurker to avoid flooding the site, make
a pause (minutes? hours? days?) then restart img-lurker: the history file will
help it resume where it was interrupted.

This makes the assumption that:

- each image will always have the same URL, e.g. no varying tokens/timestamps in the URL, etc.
- conversely, an URL will always point to the same image, it will not point to another image at some point, e.g. the
images are NOT numbered in ascending order (else `1.jpg` would point to
different images over time).

### Tell apart thumbnails from "big images" to download only the latter

    --min-thumb-size WIDTHxHEIGHT
    --min-image-size WIDTHxHEIGHT

Minimum size for an image to be considered a thumbnail worth following or an
image worth downloading. Useful not to download navigation buttons, logos, etc.
Default values are `--min-thumb-size=128x128` and `--min-image-size=400x400`.

    --max-aspect-ratio WIDTH:HEIGHT

Maximum ratio between WIDTH and HEIGHT (or HEIGHT on WIDTH, img-lurker is smart
enough to figure out) to consider an image is worth downloading.

For example, pass "16:9" and img-lurker will accept images with dimensions
1920x1080 or 1080x1920 as they are respectively 16:9 and 9:16 but also 1600x1200
or 1200x1600 because they are 4:3 (and 3:4) which is lower (more looking like
a square) than the max "16:9". Ratios of portrait and landscape are considered
equivalent.
However, passing "16:9" would discard a banner with dimensions 1200x300 because
its ratio is 4:1 which is way more distorted (very thin rectangle) than 16:9.
It would also reject a banner with dimensions 300x1200 because it is 1:4,
equivalent to 4:1.

A photo is rarely square but is almost never thin like 4:1, except panoramas, so
configure this option if you intend to download panoramas for example.
The default value is `--max-aspect-ratio=4:1`.

### Debug

    --debug

Debug log.

## Limitations

- img-lurker will not interpret javascript, though it has specific hints to detect
lazy-loaded images, so it might not work on sites like instagram.
- img-lurker will not open iframes, so it will fail to download a few images from
reddit.
- img-lurker does not crawl a site and does not support nested galleries, it only
takes one gallery and expects it to contain the images desired.
